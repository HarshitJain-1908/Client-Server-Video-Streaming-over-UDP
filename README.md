This is to perform analysis (network latency & frame loss) of video streaming over single and multipath network using
UDP on wired and wireless medium.

Deliverables:-

1. An OpenCV based setup to send and process video frames on a single and a multipath network (with minRTT scheduler).

2. A report giving insights into the following parameters on running a video stream using above setup: 
    a. Network Latency
    b. Frame Loss %
